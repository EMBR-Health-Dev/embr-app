# Milestones

## Milestone 1 — Production Foundation ✅ (this delivery)

**What changed**

- pnpm workspace + Turborepo monorepo: `apps/{api,web,admin,worker}`, `packages/{shared,types,validation,sdk,ui}`
- `apps/api`: Express + TypeScript, request-ID propagation, structured Pino logging (with secret redaction), centralized `AppError` taxonomy + global error handler, Zod-validated env config, Prisma (empty schema) + Redis clients, `/health/live` and `/health/ready` probes, OpenAPI spec served at `/docs`
- `apps/worker`: BullMQ + Redis, graceful shutdown, shared logger
- `apps/web`, `apps/admin`: Next.js 15 / React 19 shells, Tailwind configured with the EMBR brand palette (navy/bone/brass/teal), each fetching API health as a live wiring smoke test
- Docker Compose: Postgres, Redis, MailHog, and all four apps, with healthchecks and correct `depends_on` ordering
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles per app (deps → build → slim runtime, non-root user)
- GitHub Actions CI: lint/typecheck → test (against real Postgres+Redis services) → build
- ESLint (flat-config-compatible `.eslintrc.json`), Prettier, Husky + lint-staged pre-commit
- Vitest + Supertest wired in `apps/api` with passing tests for both health endpoints, request-ID echo, and the 404 error shape

**Why it changed**
See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the specific tradeoffs. In short: this milestone intentionally contains zero business features so that every later milestone (auth, symptom tracking, AI insights, payments, multi-tenancy) is built on infrastructure that's already been decided once, correctly, rather than retrofitted under feature pressure.

**Remaining work (explicitly out of scope for M1)**

- No auth, no business domain models, no frontend beyond a health-check smoke test page
- `packages/ui` and `packages/sdk` are intentionally near-empty
- Playwright e2e scaffolding is not yet wired (added when `apps/web` has real user-facing flows to test in Milestone 2/3)
- No pnpm-lock.yaml is committed yet — generate it with `pnpm install` after pulling this into a real git history, then commit it (CI depends on `--frozen-lockfile`)

**Risks**

- Docker image sizes/build times not yet benchmarked against real dependency trees — revisit after `pnpm install` produces a real lockfile
- Rate limiting is a single global limiter; brute-force protection on auth endpoints needs its own, stricter limiter in Milestone 2
- No secrets manager integration yet (`.env` only) — needs a decision (AWS Secrets Manager / Doppler / etc.) before production deploy, likely around Milestone 5/6

**Next milestone**
Milestone 2 — Authentication: registration, login, refresh tokens, password reset, email verification, device sessions, RBAC, rate limiting on auth routes specifically, audit logging, secure cookies, CSRF protection, session revocation.

## Milestone 2 — Authentication ✅ (this delivery)

**What changed**

- Prisma models: `User` (with `Role` enum), `Session` (refresh-token-backed device sessions), `EmailVerificationToken`, `PasswordResetToken`, `AuditLog`
- `apps/api/src/modules/auth`: registration, login, refresh (with rotation + reuse detection — a revoked token being replayed revokes every session for that user), logout, logout-all, email verification + resend, forgot/reset/change-password, `/auth/me`, session listing + per-session revocation
- Argon2id password hashing (OWASP-recommended parameters); opaque, SHA-256-hashed refresh tokens (never stored or transmitted as JWTs)
- Short-lived JWT access tokens (httpOnly cookie, with an `Authorization: Bearer` fallback for non-browser clients), httpOnly refresh-token cookie scoped to `/auth`
- Double-submit-cookie CSRF protection on every state-changing endpoint that acts on an existing session (refresh, logout, logout-all, change-password, session revocation) — not on register/login, which don't rely on ambient cookie auth to take effect
- Per-route rate limiting on auth endpoints specifically (keyed by email+IP where an email is present), stricter than the global API limiter
- Append-only `AuditLog` for register/login (success+failure)/refresh/reuse-detection/logout/password-change/password-reset events
- Transactional email (verification, password reset) via nodemailer → MailHog in dev
- Shared Zod validation schemas (`packages/validation`) and DTOs (`packages/types`) so `apps/web`/`apps/admin` can reuse the exact same contracts
- `requireAuth()` / `requireRole()` middleware for RBAC on future protected routes
- Vitest + Supertest coverage: registration (incl. duplicate-email conflict, weak-password rejection), login (incl. same-shape 401 for wrong-password vs. non-existent account — no enumeration), `/auth/me` auth gating, CSRF enforcement, and refresh-token rotation/reuse-detection

**Why it changed**
Argon2id + opaque hashed refresh tokens + rotation-with-reuse-detection is the combination OWASP currently recommends for session security; building it once, correctly, here avoids revisiting session handling once real user data exists. CSRF protection is scoped to cookie-authenticated state changes only (not to register/login) because that's where the actual ambient-credential attack surface is — over-applying it elsewhere adds friction without adding safety.

**Known limitation — verify before merging**
This was built in a network-sandboxed environment that cannot reach `binaries.prisma.sh`, so `prisma generate` could not run here. The Prisma-dependent code was reviewed by hand and the full test suite (mocking the Prisma client) passes, and `tsc --noEmit` is clean except for the one error `@prisma/client` has no exported member 'User'`— a direct symptom of the client never having been generated, not a real type error. Run`pnpm db:generate && pnpm typecheck`(and generate the initial migration with`pnpm db:migrate`) in an environment with normal network access — e.g. CI — before relying on this.

**Remaining work (explicitly out of scope for M2)**

- No initial Prisma migration file is committed yet — generate it once `prisma generate` can run (see limitation above)
- `requireVerifiedEmail` gating (blocking specific actions until email is confirmed) is not yet wired into any route, since no such actions exist until Milestone 3
- No account lockout after N failed logins beyond the rate limiter (a deliberate simplification — revisit if abuse patterns emerge)
- No OAuth/social login, no MFA — email+password only for this milestone

**Next milestone**
Milestone 3 — Core domain: symptom logging, cycle tracking entries, and the first real data model built on top of `User`.
