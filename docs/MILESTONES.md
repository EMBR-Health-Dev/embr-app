# Milestones

## Milestone 1 — Production Foundation ✅ (this delivery)

**What changed**

- pnpm workspace + Turborepo monorepo: `apps/{api,web,admin,worker}`, `packages/{shared,types,validation,sdk,ui}`
- `apps/api`: Express + TypeScript, request-ID propagation, structured Pino logging (with secret redaction), centralized `AppError` taxonomy + global error handler, Zod-validated env config, Prisma (empty schema) + Redis clients, `/health/live` and `/health/ready` probes, OpenAPI spec served at `/docs`
- `apps/worker`: BullMQ + Redis, graceful shutdown, shared logger
- `apps/web`, `apps/admin`: Next.js 15 / React 19 shells, Tailwind configured with the EMBR brand palette (navy/bone/brass/teal), each fetching API health as a live wiring smoke test
- Docker Compose: Postgres, Redis, MailHog, and all four apps, with healthchecks and correct `depends_on` ordering
- Multi-stage Dockerfiles per app (deps → build → slim runtime, non-root user)
- GitHub Actions CI: lint/typecheck → test (against real Postgres+Redis services) → build
- ESLint (flat-config-compatible `.eslintrc.json`), Prettier, Husky + lint-staged pre-commit
- Vitest + Supertest wired in `apps/api` with passing tests for both health endpoints, request-ID echo, and the 404 error shape

**Why it changed**
See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the specific tradeoffs. In short: this milestone intentionally contains zero business features so that every later milestone (auth, symptom tracking, AI insights, payments, multi-tenancy) is built on infrastructure that's already been decided once, correctly, rather than retrofitted under feature pressure.

**Remaining work (explicitly out of scope for M1)**

- No auth, no business domain models, no frontend beyond a health-check smoke test page
- `packages/ui` and `packages/sdk` are intentionally near-empty
- Playwright e2e scaffolding is not yet wired (added when `apps/web` has real user-facing flows to test in Milestone 2/3)
- No pnpm-lock.yaml is committed yet — generate it with `pnpm install` after pulling this into a real git history, then commit it (CI depends on `--frozen-lockfile`)

**Risks**

- Docker image sizes/build times not yet benchmarked against real dependency trees — revisit after `pnpm install` produces a real lockfile
- Rate limiting is a single global limiter; brute-force protection on auth endpoints needs its own, stricter limiter in Milestone 2
- No secrets manager integration yet (`.env` only) — needs a decision (AWS Secrets Manager / Doppler / etc.) before production deploy, likely around Milestone 5/6

**Next milestone**
Milestone 2 — Authentication: registration, login, refresh tokens, password reset, email verification, device sessions, RBAC, rate limiting on auth routes specifically, audit logging, secure cookies, CSRF protection, session revocation.
